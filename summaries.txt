document 6 summary. This M.Phil. thesis by Sibtain Raza from the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) presents a qualitative analysis of Pakistan's startup ecosystem, focusing on the challenges and opportunities for scalable business models. Based on in-depth interviews with 30 key stakeholders—including founders, investors, and officials from incubators and regulatory bodies—the research identifies significant barriers to startup growth. Key findings suggest that startups are hindered by a lack of political will due to the influence of powerful lobbies from traditional, subsidized sectors; insufficient access to early-stage funding and risk-averse bank lending practices; and a complex, often prohibitive, regulatory environment related to taxation and company laws. While incubation centers have created a community, they are often criticized for lacking specialization and adequate funding. The thesis concludes that the current ecosystem is not effectively supported and strongly recommends the creation of a comprehensive national "Entrepreneur and Startup Policy." This policy should include fiscal support mechanisms, a dedicated fund for scalability, regulatory easing, and academic interventions to build a more robust and competitive entrepreneurial environment in Pakistan.
