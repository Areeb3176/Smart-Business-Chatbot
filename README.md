# Smart-Business-Chatbot
The Smart Business Chatbot is a Business focused virtual assistant built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology. It is designed to answer complex business-related questions with high accuracy and reliability. The chatbot understands user queries, determines the best source of information (internal documents or live web), and responds with well-structured, fact-based answers. It mimics the workflow of a human researcher routing, retrieving, validating, and generating content in real time. Supports topics like branding, marketing, business planning, SEO, startup guidance, and more. Answers are streamed in real-time (typing style) for a natural chat experience. Includes fallback logic: If documents don't help, it performs live web search via Tavily API.
